# H1 TensorFlow implementation of a CNN for Text Classification

This is a fork of https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf which is the code of this blog post: http://www.wildml.com/2015/12/implementing-a-cnn-for-text-classification-in-tensorflow/.

It was modified to export the model and the vocabulary to be used in an Android Demo for TensorFlow (https://github.com/ivancruzbht/tf_android)

The model is exportes aa a Google Protobuf file
The vocabulary is exported as a json file

#H2 Requirements

+ Python 3
+ Tensorflow > 0.12
+ Numpy
